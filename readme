An invoice is a document issued by a seller to a buyer, indicating the products, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. It is an essential part of the business process, serving as a record of the transaction and a request for payment.

Our project focuses on developing a desktop application for automating the process of invoice generation. 
In the sponsoring company, invoices were previously created manually using MS Word, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. The new application aims to streamline this process by providing a user-friendly interface for generating, managing, and tracking invoices.


The Key Objectives of this project are: 
Develop a desktop application to automate invoice generation, replacing manual MS Word-based processes.
Design a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.
Implement MSSQL for efficient and scalable invoice data management.
